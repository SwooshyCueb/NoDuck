# NoDuck

Simple XPosed module that will try to replace ducking with pausing. Simply install, then enable for the apps you want to de-duck.

I threw this together over the course of a day after getting frustrated with GPS talking over my audiodramas while I was driving.

This is my first XPosed module, and my second Android app, so don't expect greatness. This was borne from frutration, not from passion. I am not a mobile dev.
